This is a big one for me technically. I spent around 4 days on this and learned so much about Responsive Web Design.

Although not perfect, I struggled to understand how to make the navbar responsive, how to align the elements correctly etc.

I could not implement CSS Grid on this but will make more projects to practice with it

SIDE-NOTE:
when faced with a problem, definitely consider taking a long break and a walk. It helps.
I personally slept overnight with the problem (like making the nav bar responsive and aligned) running in my head furiously
